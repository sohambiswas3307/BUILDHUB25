# BuildHub - Construction Platform

A one-stop platform connecting Customers, Contractors, and Labours. Designed to simplify project management, hiring, and collaboration.

## Features

- **Multi-User System**: Separate interfaces for Customers, Contractors, and Labours
- **Project Management**: Create, track, and manage construction projects
- **Transparent Hiring**: Browse and post job opportunities
- **Trust & Transparency**: Ratings, reviews, and verification system
- **Efficient Collaboration**: Real-time updates and communication

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/Express (port 5000) OR Java Spring Boot (port 8080)
- **Database**: SQLite3 with JDBC
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: JWT

## Getting Started

### ðŸš€ Quick Start (Simple - Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install all dependencies
npm run install-all

# 2. Build and start unified server
npm run build-and-start
```

**This starts everything on a single port!** 
- Visit: http://localhost:5000
- API: http://localhost:5000/api
- Backend + Frontend + Database all running together

### ðŸ’» Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Runs both servers separately:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (with hot reload)
- Backend: http://localhost:5000

### ðŸ“¦ Production

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the unified server serving the built React app.

### â˜• Java Backend (Alternative)

BuildHub also supports a **Java Spring Boot** backend with **JDBC**:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Runs on port 8080. See [JAVA_SETUP.md](JAVA_SETUP.md) for details.

**Why Java?**
- Production-ready enterprise framework
- Robust JDBC connection pooling
- Type-safe, compiled code
- Perfect for heavy computation or specialized APIs
